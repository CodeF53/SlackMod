# SlackMod
Adds a custom CSS menu to slack

## About:
A very work in progress client mod for slack.

Currently adds a Custom CSS menu:

For more detail see these blog posts of mine:

## Why?
Discord has a lot of mods to help customize and improve it. 

Slack is basically Discord but worse and targeted at professionals instead of gamers.

If Slack is worse, why isn't there any mods for it?
