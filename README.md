# SlackMod [archive]
Adds a custom CSS menu to slack

I stopped using slack after I graduated from the trade school I was attending while writing this.

I don't have any plans to further maintain this project. In future if I end up using slack or some other poorly styled electron app again I will instead try and fork [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) to be more generally applicable to all electron apps.

## About:
A very work in progress client mod for slack.

Currently adds a Custom CSS menu:

For more detail see these blog posts of mine: 
- [initial creation of this project](https://dev.to/f53/adding-a-custom-css-menu-to-slack-1090)
- [improving the editor](https://dev.to/f53/slack-mod-improving-the-editor-4hbn)
- 

## Why?
Discord has a lot of mods to help customize and improve it. 

Slack is basically Discord but worse and targeted at professionals instead of gamers.

If Slack is worse, why isn't there any mods for it?

## Setup:
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. `git clone https://github.com/CodeF53/SlackMod` and `cd SlackMod`

Or download the and extract source code

Then extract it and open a command prompt inside

3. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage:
In the directory that you cloned or extracted the mod:
```
python3 slack_launch.py
```
