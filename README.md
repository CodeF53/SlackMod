## About:
A very work in progress client mod for slack.

Currently adds a Custom CSS menu:

For more detail see these blog posts of mine:

## Why?
Discord has a lot of mods to help customize and improve it. 

Slack is basically Discord but worse and targeted at professionals instead of gamers.

If Slack is worse, why isn't there any mods for it?

## Usage
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. `git clone https://github.com/CodeF53/SlackMod` and `cd SlackMod`

Or download the and extract source code

Then open a command prompt inside

3. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Make sure slack is fully closed
5. `python3 slack_launch.py`
